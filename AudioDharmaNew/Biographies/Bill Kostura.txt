Bill Kostura has been sitting since 2001, and has studied primarily with Gil Fronsdal in Redwood City. At present he explores the teachings primarily through perspectives on suffering and non-attachment. He feels fortunate to teach Buddhist meditation regularly at a couple of places, including at a state prison in Monterey County. He works as an architectural historian, and has published widely in that field.
