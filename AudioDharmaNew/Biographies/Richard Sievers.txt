Richard Sievers was introduced to Vipassana meditation in 1984 on his first 10 day retreat with Sister Ayya Khema, a Buddhist nun from Sri Lanka. Along the path he has had the good fortune of practicing with many dharma teachers, Steve Armstrong, Kamala Master, Jack Kornfield, John Travis, and since moving to the peninsula in 1998, Gil Fronsdal at IMC. His practice continues with great appreciation for the Dharma.
