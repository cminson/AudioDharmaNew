Mirka Knaster has practiced in the Theravada tradition since her first retreat in India in 1981. An independent scholar and freelance writer and editor, she has written Living This Life Fully: Stories and Teachings of Munindra (Shambhala), a book about the meditation master who first taught Dipa Ma, Joseph Goldstein, and many of our western dharma leaders. He was a pivotal figure in the transmission of Dharma to the West and the resulting mindfulness movement. Mirka's last book, Discovering the Body's Wisdom (Bantam) invites readers to befriend their body and explore the benefits of Eastern and Western body-mind disciplines.
